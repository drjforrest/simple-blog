# Simple Blog

I needed a mechanism through which I could post simple blogs sinve my main blog sie in the next.js frameework can be arduous. This is a solutiom to that need by creating an api to interact with my hosting platform on Vercel through CI/CD hooks I can very quickly gemnerate content, post it to the hosting server and link it to a card on my blog.drjforrest.com next.js. 

Comes with a mini client also, but kept in a seperate reposiotory for best security practices.

## Quiuck Start

To get started:

`npm install'

then 'npm run dev'
